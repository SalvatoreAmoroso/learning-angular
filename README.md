# LearningAngular

This project shows the major concepts of angular. Each concept is illustrated on its own and can be examined independently from each other.

## Get Started

Firstly run the program by the `ng serve --open` command. Every concept is illustrated in the ui. To understand how things work open the corresponding code in the src/app/ folder.
